/* Write a program to prepare the bill for a pizza shop.
 Assume an order and work out the final bill.
 Take the Cheese Pizza prices as: Small Pizza: $15, Medium Pizza: $20, Large Pizza: $25
 For additional pepperoni topping: Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2, Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
 Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1
For eg: If the Pizza is medium, pepperoni with extra cheese the program should calculate the final bill as 20+3+1 = $24 and print as
“Your final bill is $24”
